# **Domain Modeling**
##  Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

### Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## What's a Table?
### A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
## Basic Table Structure :
~~~
'<table>' : The '<table>' element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
'<tr>' : You indicate the start of each row using the opening '<tr>' tag.(The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more
'<td>' : elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing '</tr>' tag.
'<td>' : Each cell of a table is represented using a '<td>' element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing '</td>' tag.
~~~
## **Table Headings**
~~~
'<th>' :The '<th>' element is used just like the '<td>' element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.
